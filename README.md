This repo does two things:
1) Records artnet data to a file
2) Sets up and runs a python program on a Raspberry Pi that plays these recordings, and also plays audio

# Recording ArtNet
* python recorder/record.py
* Send ArtNet data to 127.0.0.1:6454 (default ArtNet port)
* Press 's' + Enter to stop recording and save the file

# Pi
## Setup
* Install the RPI image to the sd card via the Raspberry Pi Imager program. Change the settings such that ssh is turned on, and there's a default user
* Turn on the RPI with the imaged sd card
* "share ethernet" from mac. Connect mac ethernet to RPI.
* ssh pi@pi.local
* sudo raspi-config nonint do_wifi_ssid_passphrase "spacebase2" meowmeow2
    * I don't know why the RPI imager wifi settings didn't work automatically for me.
* Get the wifi ip address
* Now ssh via wifi
* sudo apt update
* mkdir -p artnet-play
* Make the RPI act as a router, so that it can give the LED controller an ip address and communicate with it.
    * sudo nmcli c add con-name pi-eth-shared type ethernet ifname eth0 ipv4.method shared ipv6.method ignore
    * sudo nmcli c up pi-eth-shared
* Add ssh keys for convenience
    * This could alternatively be done via the Imager program
    * mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    * vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
        * add key..
* Now upload all these files on by running this locally:
    * rsync -avz ../artnet-playÂ  pi@192.168.1.156:~/
* Then run this on the RPI:
    * cd ~/artnet-play && sudo sh setup.sh

play.py should be running now, and will run at startup.

## Get Logs
* journalctl -u run_play.service -f
